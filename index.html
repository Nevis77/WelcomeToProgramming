    <p class="intro">Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, In which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand</p>
    <p>There are primarily four types of programming, imperative, functional, logical and object-oriented. Alternative names and other primary types may include procedural, scripting and database programming</p>
    <p>Programming in a sense, is a way by which humans communicate to computers from a higher level language such as any spoken, most popularly English, to a lower level language that
        the computer understands, that is machine language or more popularly known as binary.
    </p>

    <p>With the age of the internet, any one person can begin their journey to become a programmer. However, its not as simple as hoping on YouTube and binging tutorials in hopes to understand everything
        as if learning by diffusion. Practice is key as you teach yourself how to implement what you've learnt while building muscle memory, enabling you to easily recall the context within which
        that particular principle will be applied. <br>

        Programmers are, in a nutshell, problem-solvers whose main job is to essentially breathe their thoughts into life through code. If you wanted to implement a simple calculator that
        would perform basic calculations, it is easy to think how it would work (especially if you've been through formal education) but actually implementing it may prove a challenge especially
        to newer programmers just starting out. <br>
        
        This therefore shows us that programmers also need other skills in order to be truly a problem solver. Some of these skills include:
        <ol>
            <li>Critical thinking.</li>
            <li>Open-mindedness.</li>
            <li>Problem-Solving.</li>
            <li>Teamwork.</li>
            <li>Communication Skills.</li>
            <li>Patience.</li>
            <li>Adaptability.</li>
            <li>Self-Motivation.</li>
            <li>Discipline.</li>
        </ol>

<p>Some people say that I type fast but i dont believe that that's the case. From their view, it may seem that I type fast but in a sense it could be that my fast is actaully <br> the 
normal way I type. <br> If I wnt to type fast I belive I can but tyyping fast takes practice. Thye say to assume the spider hand symbol but I don't really feel comfortable with that. It doesn't seem natural to me and hence the reason I type like this. <br>
At the end of the day it is only a matter of preference and what works for me may not work for any other person. As long as i get my point across thats what truly matters</p>
